We provide three on-ramps to get started with Composabl:

## :motorway: Try

1. Set up the environment and start training your first agent in 2 minutes or less.
2. Build one of our project agents from scratch in a 30 minute tutorial.

## :motorway: Learn

Follow along with the Machine Teaching methodology to build and test one of our project agents from scratch (30 minutes).

## :motorway: Build

Jump right in and start building with the Composabl Python SDK. Refer back to our advanced project example, build an agent, test it and appear on our leaderboard!
